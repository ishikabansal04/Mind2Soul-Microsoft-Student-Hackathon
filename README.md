## üìú DESCRIPTION
<p align = "justify">
We know how uncomforting things can get when one has a tremendous amount of mental stress. Our Web-App Mind2Soul will give you the correct perspective and a way to deal with them. 
You can subscribe to receive a daily dose of motivation right in your mailbox and book 1:1 sessions with trained counselors offering emotional support. Post your thoughts to share your story with others and clear all your mental health queries via interacting with Azure Chatbot.

## üö© INSPIRATION
<p align = "justify">
Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children or work in the next cubicle.<br>
However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Although the general perception of mental illness has improved over the past decades, studies show that stigma against mental illness is still powerful, largely due to media stereotypes and lack of education, and that people tend to attach negative stigmas to mental health conditions at a far higher rate than to other diseases and disabilities, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease. <br>
Our Web-App Mind2Soul helps people understand and recognise mental health difficulties, and to start making the steps towards recovery.
